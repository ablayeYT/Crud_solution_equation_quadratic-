# Crud_solution_equation_quadratic-
In this project, I present a crud for solving quadratic equations developed using html, css and php. For the solution of the quadratic equations the general formula that can be observed below was used.

    x1 = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c) )/2a
    x2 = (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c) )/2a

What is a quadratic equation?

A quadratic or quadratic equation is any equation in which, once simplified, the greatest exponent of the unknown is 2. Thus, ax2 + bx + c = 0 is a quadratic equation. In this equation "x" is the variable or unknown and the letters a, b and c are the coefficients, which can have any value, except that a = 0.
